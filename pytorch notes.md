# pytorch notes



``` shell
epoch = 1 forward and backward pass of ALL training samples
batch_size = number of training samples in one forward & backward pass
number of interations = number of passes, each pass using [batch_sze] number of samples
e.g. 100 samples, batch_size=20 --> 100/20 = 5 iterations for 1 epoch
```
