# Distributed System #

### What is a distributed system

- bunch of nodes/processes
- sending messages over a network 
- to solve a common goal (algorithm)

#### Modeling a node

+ A single node has a bunch of neighbors
    * Can send and receive messages
    * Can do local computations
+ Model node by state transition system (STS)
    + Like a finite state machine, except 
        + Need not be finite
        + No input
